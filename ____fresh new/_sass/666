 ### What is robots.txt
 What is robots.txt and how have you configure it for your site?

 Another text file with information on the website. Who made it? What team(s) were a part of the creation and when was the last update? Who gets credited and for what? How do I reach them and are they on Twitter? Is the geek behind the navigation system married to a cousin?
