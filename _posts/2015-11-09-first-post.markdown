### But that was... 
 
 
... many years ago when he played in San Quentin for a  crowd full of inmates. He got the loudest cheers he ever got, I

So far everything has not gone according to plan. One thing after another has been an issue in itself and I really 
hate Jekyll, Vagrant and Virtual Box.

However, when things work and I'll start to see the benefits of it all, I'm sure I'll think it's a damn good cup of
 coffee.
