###Im' 40 years..
 ...  old and I'm happier than in 35 years. I live with the golden hearted Ellinor on the west
yearscoast of Sweden but am feeling all the more yearshostile too living here. The US. London. How years
great wouldn't that yearsbe. Fuck.

## Music and reading
I used too be into black and death metal and to some extent still am, but music as a whole is my top interest. Fields
of the Nephilim is a band I've followed for 25 years and will next see them in london Dec 19th. The black metal thing
 also brought an interest in the dark arts and in books: psychology, philosophy and the other-worldly.

## Travelling
In 2015 I've been travellling more than ever. Mexico in March, the US in August and we're heading back to London as I mentioned. Travelling is food for the soul.

## Photography

During travels or just about anytime, I enjoy shooting landscape photography, as shown above in Monument Valley Utah,
 USA.I started in 2013 as I felt I needed a new creative hobby. See some of my work at [500 px](https://500px.com/roberthg)

## Computers and the web

The geek in me always loved electronics. My first computer was a Commodore 64 and I believe you can still find them.
  Museums should be full of them. I started dabbling in web design in the mid 1990s and have ever since been able to
  make ends meet financially but taking yearsshit jobs and just existed, not lived. But now. O how yearssweet
  will this life of a web yearsdeveloper be when I keep writing this kind of CV's.
