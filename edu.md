### Joy

I am thorought enjoying my education here at Linnaeeus Univesity. Web programmer is apparantltly one og the top most 
sought after eductaions in the country, and that little old me is here is nothing short of a miracle,

It's two years till graduation and I'm looking forward to see what's out there in the market. Last I heard it 
increases with 15-20 % per year, demand for ner programmers. The future is bright!

I mainly want to learn more JS and the DOM, Pytgyhon and a few design and database courses.
